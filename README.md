# breweryApp

## Practise assignment

Uses a brewery API to get breweries in Georgia and picks the northernmost and southernmost to show, also the first added.
Has popup windows to display some additional data I chose randomly just to show.

Built for android with QT 5.15 with Android Qt 6.5.1 x86_64 kit.

Not finished, missing styling and possibly more features.
